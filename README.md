## Description
This practical demonstrates the use of variables in Python.  
Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning data types do not need to be explicitly declared.

---

## Variables Used
The following variables were created in the program:

- `name` (String) – Stores the student's full name
- `age` (Integer) – Stores the student's age
- `gpa` (Float) – Stores the student's GPA
- `is_student` (Boolean) – Stores the student status

---

## Python Program

```python
name = "Given Kanchalu"
age = 28
gpa = 3.8
is_student = True

print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("GPA:", gpa)
print("Student?", is_student)
